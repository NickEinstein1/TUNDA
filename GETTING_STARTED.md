# Getting Started with TUNDA

Welcome to **TUNDA** — a local **affect-aware voice companion**. It labels emotion (audio on desktop when configured; mostly text/keywords on the web), can reply via a local LLM, and includes crisis routing and grounding scripts.

It is **not** a therapist, not emergency care, and not a validated “empathic AI.” Supportive tone comes from prompts, templates, and safety scripts. See the [README](README.md) for honest scope.

## What you get

- **Affect labels**: Used to condition reply style and TTS — not clinical diagnosis
- **Supportive replies**: Local LLM (Ollama) when online; Companion may use templates offline; care profiles refuse template improv if the LLM is down
- **Multiple interfaces**: Desktop voice, web UI, and API
- **Privacy-oriented**: Local processing by default; consent and wipe options for memory
- **Conversation continuity**: Recaps and session memory (full RAG into replies is strongest on the desktop path)
- **Response styles**: Supportive, reflective, solution-focused, and therapeutic-*inspired* prompts (not certified therapy)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd empathic-voice-companion

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Use the safe installer (handles compatibility issues)
python install.py

# OR install minimal dependencies manually
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

### 2. Setup Models and System Dependencies

```bash
# Run the automated setup script
python setup_models.py

# This will:
# - Check system requirements
# - Install audio dependencies (FFmpeg, PyAudio)
# - Download Whisper models for speech recognition
# - Setup Piper TTS for speech synthesis
# - Optionally setup Ollama for advanced LLM responses
```

### 3. Test Your Installation

```bash
# Run system tests
python test_system.py

# This will verify all components are working correctly
```

### 4. Start Using the System

#### Option A: Voice Interface (Recommended)
```bash
python main.py
```
- Speak naturally into your microphone
- The system will detect your emotions and respond empathically
- Press Ctrl+C to stop

#### Option B: Web Interface
```bash
python app.py
```
- Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
- Type messages and receive empathic responses
- View emotion patterns and conversation history

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Voice Interaction
```
You: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed with work today"
🎯 Processing speech...
😊 Detected emotion: anxious (confidence: 0.78)
🤖 Response: "I can hear the stress and worry in your voice. Feeling overwhelmed at work is really challenging, and it's completely understandable. You're not alone in feeling this way. What's been the most overwhelming part of your day?"
🔊 Generating speech...
✅ Speech played
```

### Emotion Patterns
The system tracks your emotional journey:
- **Most common emotion**: Shows your predominant emotional state
- **Recent trend**: Indicates if you're feeling better, worse, or stable
- **Interaction history**: Maintains context across conversations

## 🛠️ Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
# Emotion detection sensitivity
emotion_detection:
  confidence_threshold: 0.6  # Lower = more sensitive

# Response style
response_generation:
  default_style: "supportive"  # supportive, reflective, solution_focused, therapeutic
  temperature: 0.7  # Higher = more creative responses

# Voice settings
text_to_speech:
  emotion_adaptive: true  # Adjust voice based on detected emotion
  speaking_rate: 1.0
```

## 🎨 Empathy Styles

### Supportive (Default)
- Validates emotions warmly
- Provides encouragement and comfort
- Example: *"I can hear the sadness in your voice, and I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way. You're not alone."*

### Reflective
- Mirrors back emotions and thoughts
- Helps process feelings
- Example: *"I notice a real heaviness in how you're speaking. You're expressing genuine sadness right now."*

### Solution-Focused
- Acknowledges emotions while guiding toward solutions
- Practical and forward-looking
- Example: *"I hear your frustration, and it sounds like something important needs to be addressed. What would need to change for you to feel better?"*

### Therapeutic
- Uses CBT-inspired techniques
- Helps reframe thoughts and feelings
- Example: *"Sadness can be difficult to sit with, but it's also a sign that something matters to you. What thoughts are accompanying this sadness?"*

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Custom Voice Models
Add your own Piper TTS voices:
1. Download `.onnx` voice files from [Piper Voices](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices)
2. Place in `models/piper_voices/`
3. Update `config.yaml` voice mappings

### LLM Integration
For more sophisticated responses:
1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai
2. Run: `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`
3. The system will automatically use Ollama for enhanced responses

### Training Custom Emotion Models
```python
from src.emotion.detector import EmotionDetector

detector = EmotionDetector()
# Provide your own labeled audio files
detector.train_model(audio_files, labels)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
```bash
# Test audio devices
python -c "import pyaudio; p=pyaudio.PyAudio(); print(f'Found {p.get_device_count()} audio devices')"

# On Linux, you may need:
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio

# On macOS:
brew install portaudio
```

### Speech Recognition Issues
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check microphone levels in system settings
- Try different Whisper models: `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large`

### TTS Issues
```bash
# Test system TTS
# Windows: Uses SAPI (built-in)
# macOS: Uses 'say' command
# Linux: Install espeak: sudo apt-get install espeak
```

### Memory Issues
- Reduce model sizes in `config.yaml`
- Use `tiny` Whisper model for lower memory usage
- Disable conversation saving if needed

## 📊 Understanding the Output

### Emotion Detection
- **Confidence**: 0.0-1.0 scale, higher means more certain
- **Supported Emotions**: happy, sad, angry, anxious, calm, neutral
- **Features Used**: MFCC, pitch, spectral features, prosodic analysis

### Response Quality
- **Response Confidence**: How confident the AI is in its response
- **Generation Time**: How long it took to generate the response
- **Empathy Style**: Which approach was used

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All audio and text processing happens on your device
- **No External APIs**: Optional Ollama runs locally
- **Conversation Storage**: Saved locally in `data/conversations.json`
- **Data Control**: Delete conversation history anytime
